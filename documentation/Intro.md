# Introduction

## Scope

The system, a Software-as-a-Service, is an online diagnostic lab manager application that brings up various diagnosis working online. Patients are first allowed to register on the site, by setting their personal information, and also be authenticated through a username and password. Once registered, the patients may now see a variety of labs and the list of tests conducted by each lab along with their costs. Lab tests may refer to several departments, like biochemistry, clinical pathology, hematology, radiology, etc. After adding tests to cart, the system calculates costs and allows users to pay online. After payment, the patient's booking is submitted and the lab proceeds with the test execution handling. After successful testing, the user gets a message when the test results are ready and has the option to download or print them. The administrator receives messages from new labs, which want to enter the system.
