# Introduction

## Scope

The system, a Software-as-a-Service, is an online diagnostic lab manager application that enables users to experience the booking of various diagnostic tests. Patients are first allowed to register on the system, by setting their personal information, and also be authenticated through a username and password. Once registered, the patients may now see a variety of labs and the list of tests conducted by each lab along with their costs. Lab tests may refer to several departments, like biochemistry, clinical pathology, hematology, radiology, etc. After adding tests to cart, the system calculates costs and allows users to pay online. When the payment is  processed, the patient's booking is submitted and the lab proceeds with the test execution handling. After successful testing, the user gets a message when the test results are ready and has the option to download or print them. The administrator receives messages from new labs and creates accounts for the qualified ones. 

Laballey is a system that offers patients the convenience to book an appointment in a few minutes, through a simple and user-friendly environment. Patients will be pleased to discover an extensive catalogue of tests, covering a majority of the routine testing needs. Sometimes, a possible backlog of appointments leads to patient discomfort and big delays in check-ups that must be conducted immediately. Our system offers users the possibility to detect labs that provide same tests and choose the ones that suit them most. Moreover, caregivers that look after elderly people will be able to book appointments on their behalf and opt for the home sample pick up. Patients can download or print test results as soon as the latter are provided by the lab assistants, without having to go to the lab's office to pick them. From the perspective of the labs, through Laballey, they promote themselves and achieve an active presence in the market. Many time-consuming procedures are automated and, as a consequence, the lab staff can focus on more meaningful duties. Only high-quality laboratories are chosen to enter the system, in order to ensure reliability and test accuracy.
